                <h2>What services do you offer?</h2>
                <p>We are a family-owned farm offering a range of services to support our community and local food businesses. Our storefront features fresh local goods along with our homemade ice cream, while our food truck serves delicious ice cream as well as gourmet hot dogs and brats and is available for hire at events. We provide a fully licensed commissary kitchen where food entrepreneurs can prepare, cook, and store their products safely. For growers, we offer greenhouse space to cultivate fresh produce, which can also be sold in our storefront. Additionally, we have a variety of farm animals available for purchase, including chickens, ducks, pigs, geese, turkeys, rabbits, and goats. We are also excited about plans to open a petting zoo and to host events such as weddings here on the farm in the near future. Please see our services page for more information!</p>
